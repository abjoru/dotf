$ dotf status
# On branch blueberry
# Changes to be committed:
#
#       modified:   file1
#       modified:   file2
#       modified:   file3
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add/rm <file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
#
#       both modified:      file4
#
```

To view changes that was automatically merged:
```sh
$ dotf diff --cached file1
...
$ dotf checkout HEAD file1      # to keep the original file
$ dotf checkout master file1    # to replace with master copy
```
